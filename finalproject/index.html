    	<div id="text1">This is a picture of Indonesian Soup Noodles from Los Angeles! I enjoyed the delicious bowl from my home town, Alhambra, over the summer and it satisfied my cravings for hokkien fusion cuisine. Recently, Alhambra has become much more gentrified as new places (such as the Indonesian fusion restaurant where this picture was taken) pop up around Main Street. Three stars!</div>

    	<div id="text2">In all honesty, the crepes in this picture look beautiful but I didn't enjoy them at all. The dough for the crepe tasted very bland and the cheesy layer beneath the smoked salmon overpowered the dish. However, I really enjoyed the lemon tea in the top right corner -- taken in Central, Hong Kong. </div>

    	<div id="text3">A Beautiful Brunch in Oahu, Hawaii -- I don't eat brunch often, but out of all the meals of the day, brunch is presented in the most aesthetic way. The toast was just the way I like it -- very sweet -- and I loved the powdered sugar. The marmalade jam was also a nice touch; the citrus flavors of the island really came through.</div>
